Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The autoendoproteolytic cleavage occurs by a canonical serine protease mechanism, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl prosthetic group on the alpha chain. During this reaction, the Ser that is part of the protease active site of the proenzyme becomes the pyruvoyl prosthetic group, which constitutes an essential element of the active site of the mature decarboxylase. {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03208}.",

         "PTM: Is synthesized initially as an inactive proenzyme. Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The autoendoproteolytic cleavage occurs by a canonical serine protease mechanism, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl prosthetic group on the alpha chain. During this reaction, the Ser that is part of the protease active site of the proenzyme becomes the pyruvoyl prosthetic group, which constitutes an essential element of the active site of the mature decarboxylase. {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03209}.",

TREX-2 contains 2 SUS1 chains. The TREX-2 complex interacts with the nucleoporin NUP1. Component of the 1.8 MDa SAGA transcription coactivator-HAT complex. SAGA is built of 5 distinct domains with specialized functions. Within the SAGA complex, SUS1, SGF11, SGF73 and UBP8 form an additional subcomplex of SAGA called the DUB module (deubiquitination module).

At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators, and chromatin modification through histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates to a subcomplex required for deubiquitination of H2B and for the maintenance of steady-state H3 methylation levels. The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket). TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery. May also be involved in cytoplasmic mRNA decay by interaction with components of P-bodies. {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03046}.",
