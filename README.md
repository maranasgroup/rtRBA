# *rt*RBA: *R. toruloides* Resource Balance Analysis model
This repository provides resources and model files for the genome-scale resource balance analysis (RBA) model *rt*RBA.

Program and packages requirements for the provided software implementation: Python 3 (plus packages: cobra, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter, scikit-learn, cplex (compiled from installed CPLEX linear programming solver), and all automatically-installed associated dependencies to those already listed) and GAMS with ("built-in") Soplex solver. (Tested on Python 3.6 and GAMS 39.1.0. Python package installation could be done through "pip" and could take up to 1 hour)
gsm_custom_functions.py contains many useful functions, and may be easier to use if you move it into your $PYTHONPATH directory.‚Äù<br><br>
To build this model, I modified and expanded upon code from another model - the paper below has more info about it:<br>

# Installation
To install directly via the environment.yml file, Anaconda must already be installed. To create a self-contained environment for RBA, activate the Anaconda prompt and type:
```conda env create -f <path to environment.yml file>```
# Building an RBA model
See "RBA User Guide.docx" under suppMat.
